Dexter
======
A collection of machine learning algorithms for go.

This project consist of multiple sub-packages which are each independently "go gettable". Open each sub-package to view the package specific README which will include API documentation and example code.

Dexter currently implements the following algorithms:
- Artificial Neural Networks (ann)
- Hidden Markov Models (hmm)
- K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (knn)
- Naive Bayes Classifier (nba)
